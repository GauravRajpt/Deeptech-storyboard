# DeepTech Storyboard Internship Project

## Overview

This project, named "DeepTech Storyboard Internship Project," aims to create a dynamic web page based on a provided Figma file and JSON data. The web page utilizes CSS flexbox to ensure flexibility and responsiveness.

## Features

- **Figma File:** The project includes a Figma file that serves as a design reference, ensuring accurate visual representation during development.

- **JSON Data:** A JSON data file is provided, which serves as the data source for populating the web page dynamically.

- **Flexible Layout:** CSS flexbox is utilized to create a flexible and responsive layout for the web page, ensuring optimal display across different devices and screen sizes.

- **Asset Containers:** One of the key features of the project is the creation of a reusable function to generate asset containers. By passing data to this function, the content is dynamically displayed inside the containers. This eliminates the need for writing repetitive HTML code for each container.

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: [GitHub Repository URL](https://github.com/GauravRajpt/Deeptech-storyboard/tree/main)

2. Open the project directory and locate the Figma file and JSON data.

3. Use a code editor to modify the necessary files according to your requirements.

4. Launch the web page in a browser to view the dynamic content generated based on the provided JSON data.

## Conclusion

I am proud of the outcome achieved through this internship project. It has not only allowed me to further strengthen my technical skills but also provided me with hands-on experience in working with real-world data and design specifications. I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the field of DeepTech and showcase my abilities in developing interactive web applications.
